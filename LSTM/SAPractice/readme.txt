Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Practice Task!

25000 txt files in /train are movie reviews with 'neg' and 'pos' in the file names demonstrating its sentiment polarity.
25000 txt files in /test are movie reviews without annotation. Your task is to assign a positive or negative attitude to each and every of the 25000 test files.
Your submission must be named 'answer.txt', and the answer.txt in this repository serves as a sample. Specifically, each line contains a file ID and a sentiment label, with 1 as positive and 0 as negative. The file IDs doesn't need to be ordered.
